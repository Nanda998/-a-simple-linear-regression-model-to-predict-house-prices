# A simple linear regression model to predict house prices
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Overview
This project builds a Simple Linear Regression Model to predict house prices using square footage and number of bedrooms. We use Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to prepare the data, train the model, and test its accuracy. The model's performance is measured using error metrics, and the results are visualized with a graph. This helps in understanding how machine learning can be used for price prediction.
