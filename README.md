# A simple linear regression model to predict house prices
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Overview
This project builds a Simple Linear Regression Model to predict house prices using square footage and number of bedrooms. We use Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to prepare the data, train the model, and test its accuracy. The model's performance is measured using error metrics, and the results are visualized with a graph. This helps in understanding how machine learning can be used for price prediction.

# Features
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Input Features:
       Square footage of the house.
       Number of bedrooms.
       Number of bathrooms.
 * Prediction Output:
       Estimated price of the house.
 * Model Evaluation:
       Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score to assess model performance.
 * Data Visualization:
       Plots showing feature relationships, residuals, and model fit.

# Technologies Used
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:
   * pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
   * NumPy: For numerical computations.
   * scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the regression model.
   * matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.

# Data Set
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* The dataset contains details about houses, including square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and their corresponding prices.
* Sample datasets (like the Boston housing dataset) or custom datasets can be used.
